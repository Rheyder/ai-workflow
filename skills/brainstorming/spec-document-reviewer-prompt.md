# Spec document reviewer prompt template

Use this template when dispatching a reviewer sub-agent on `spec-*` (or equivalent).

**Purpose:** Verify the spec is complete, consistent, and ready for planning.

**Trigger after:** Spec file is written (see naming in [workflow-conventions.md](../../reference/workflow-conventions.md)).

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Review spec document"
  prompt: |
    You are a spec document reviewer. Verify this spec is complete and ready for planning.

    **Spec to review:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

    ## What to Check

    | Category | What to Look For |
    |----------|------------------|
    | Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", incomplete sections |
    | Consistency | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements |
    | Clarity | Requirements ambiguous enough to build the wrong thing |
    | Scope | Focused enough for a single plan — not multiple independent subsystems |
    | YAGNI | Unrequested features, over-engineering |

    ## Calibration

    **Only flag issues that would cause real problems during implementation planning.**
    A missing section, a contradiction, or a requirement ambiguous enough for two interpretations — those are issues. Minor wording,
    stylistic preferences, and "sections less detailed than others" are not.

    Approve unless there are serious gaps that would lead to a flawed plan.

    ## Output Format

**Reviewer output:** Status, Issues (if any), Recommendations.
